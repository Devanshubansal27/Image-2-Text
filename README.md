This is an AI-powered Streamlit application that converts images to text using Google’s Gemini model. The app allows users to upload an image or provide a text prompt and generates AI-powered insights based on the image content or the provided prompt.

## Features

- **Image Upload:** Upload images (JPG, JPEG, PNG) for text-based insights generated by AI.
- **Text Input:** Enter a text prompt for additional AI-powered responses.
- **AI-Powered Insights:** Utilizes Google’s Gemini AI to process both images and text, providing detailed responses based on the input.

## How to Use

1. **Upload an Image:** Click on the "Upload an Image" button and select a file (JPG, JPEG, PNG). The app will process the image and generate insights based on its content.
2. **Enter a Prompt (Optional):** You can enter a text prompt related to the image for the AI to process and generate relevant insights.
3. **Generate Response:** After uploading the image or entering a prompt, click "Generate Response" to receive AI-generated insights based on the content.

## Technical Stack

- **Streamlit:** For building the interactive web application.
- **Google GenerativeAI (Gemini):** For generating text-based responses from the image and/or text input.
- **Pillow (PIL):** For image processing and display.
